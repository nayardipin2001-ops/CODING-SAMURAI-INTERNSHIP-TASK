# CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK
Multi-Project Machine Learning Portfolio
This repository showcases fundamental machine learning concepts and workflows through two distinct projects: Classification (Titanic Survival) and Regression (Advertising Sales).

1. Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification)
This project applies a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival on the historic Titanic dataset.
Model & Task:
Model: Logistic Regression

Task: Binary Classification (Survived/Did Not Survive)
Key Features & Analysis:
Data Preparation: Loading, cleaning missing data (Age), and simplifying the feature set.
Feature Engineering: Utilizing features like 'Class', 'Gender', and 'Age'.
Performance Evaluation:
Calculating standard classification metrics including Accuracy Score and Classification Report.
Visualizing performance using a Confusion Matrix heatmap and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve.
Goal: To build a simple, yet effective, model to identify the most significant factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

2. Advertising Sales Prediction (Multiple Linear Regression)
This project focuses on forecasting sales revenue based on advertising expenditures across three different media channels.
Model & Task:
Model: Multiple Linear Regression
Task: Regression / Continuous Prediction ('Sales ($)')
Key Features & Analysis:
Feature Analysis: Determines the specific coefficients (slopes) for each channel (TV, Radio, Newspaper) to quantify its unique impact on sales revenue.
This provides direct insight into which advertising medium offers the highest marginal return.
Model Evaluation: Assesses predictive accuracy using critical regression metrics such as:
$R^2$ Score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Visualization: Visualizes the model's predictive quality by comparing Actual vs. Predicted Sales values.

Outcome: A clear, quantitative analysis to help optimize future advertising budget allocation.
